# Function Fun!

This excercise is meant to show the importance of functions and breaking up your code into more managable tasks for programming teams

It will also show you the usefulness of github and how teams of programmers can work on the same program without knowing the code of the others

This exercise was based on lesson 6 and below.

Summary
We are going to write an advanced game of guess the word to demonstrate how we use funtions
Below are 7 functions that are used for the main program. Each Group needs to define their function
with the right inputs and it needs to return the proper value. The function name is given along with what inputs
it needs and what it should return.
